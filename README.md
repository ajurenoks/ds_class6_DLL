# Python Double Linked List Examples

Welcome to our repository, where we delve into the implementation and usage of double linked lists in Python. Double linked lists are a fundamental data structure, where each element (or node) contains references to the next and the previous node in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements from any position within the list.

## What's Inside

This repository is structured to provide clear and concise examples of how to work with double linked lists in Python. Here's what you can find:

- `append_example.py` - Demonstrates how to append a new node to the end of the list.
- `get_example.py` - Shows how to access a node by its position in the list.
- `insert_example.py` - Illustrates inserting a new node at a specified position in the list.
- `pop_first_example.py` - Explains how to remove the first node from the list.
- `pop_example.py` - Provides an example of removing a node from the end of the list.
- `prepend_example.py` - Demonstrates how to add a new node at the beginning of the list.
- `remove_example.py` - Shows how to remove a node by its value.
- `set_example.py` - Illustrates how to replace the value of a node at a certain position.

Each file contains a standalone example that is fully documented, explaining the key concepts and steps involved in performing each operation.

## Getting Started
